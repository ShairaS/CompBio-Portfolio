# REDCap API Automation Project

This project demonstrates a simple Python script that pulls a report from REDCap and exports it to Excel. It was created as a beginner-level prototype to showcase research data infrastructure skills, and to demonstrate practical workflow automation for research data management.

Skills demonstrated include:
- Using APIs to access research data
- Basic data handling and automation with Python
- Organizing and exporting data using pandas

Potential future directions include:
-Automating batch exports 
-Automating data cleaning or data validation steps
