# Resting-State fMRI Functional Connectivity Pipeline
This project demonstrates a functional connectivity pipeline completed using one participant's resting-state fMRI data. The goal of the pipeline is to visualize the correlations between the BOLD signals of brain regions to get an understanding of which areas' activation may be related to each other.
